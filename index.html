        <p>‚óâ Animal Crossing is a caring and responsible organization, aiming to help you find a pet that suits you
            best. We
            are trying to provide a cherishable experience for both the first-time pet owners and our four paws friends.
            Don‚Äôt know that kind of animal that fits you? Want to adopt or foster animals? Animal Crossing is here to
            help!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>‚óâ Our primary target audience are first- time pet owners who have little knowledge and experience about
            raising
            and training pets. Our secondary target audience are people looking for animals to adopt or foster. Through
            the
            quick test, we will have a basic understanding of adopters, then AI is used for intelligent matching with
            suitable dog or cat breeds as well as other suggestions which include the information of the certain breeds.

                We distributed 500 questionnaires. In our questionnaire, our first question is about the age group of
                users.
                We
                found that 80% of people who like our website are young people aged 18-24, so we know our target users.

                We will intelligently match the most suitable pets with AI based on the information we received from the
                questionnaires. At the same time, when users register our software or fill in personal information on
                the
                website, we will locate our users' locations and intelligently match suitable pets. After that, our
                results
                will
                provide the address of suitable pets' nearest shelter.

                We voluntarily joined the local animal protection organization. When working in the organization, we had
                contact with the local animal shelter. After listening to our idea of caring for animals, they liked it
                very much and are willing to do non-profit cooperation with us. We all want to help the animals find
                their most suitable owners and reduce the probability of people giving up their pets halfway.

                    Hi, I‚Äôm Mason, I am a senior student majoring in computer science. I am extremely passionate about
                    this
                    project not only because it is a great opportunity to practice my web design skills but also
                    because I love all kinds of animals. Back in my home in China, my home is like a mini-zoo where my
                    mom
                    raise rabbits, cats, dogs, birds and a turtle ;) Hope you like our project.

                    Beagle, the kind of dog well known for their crazy personality, for almost 8 years, I have seen
                    plenty
                    of people abandoning their pets due to training problems, not having enough time, or pets not
                    matching
                    their expectations, etc. Therefore, I want to build and ensure a responsible and warm community for

                    familiar with the adoption process. In the pet adoption center, there are so many lovely animals

            This research proves that if the app is well-designed then pet adopters will have a reason to use the app
            and the questionnaire built into the app, along with the artificial intelligence matching of the app itself,
            will help the pet adopters to find their most suitable pets and ensure the lowest posibillity of people
            giving up their pets. Our research will start with why people give up small animals to summarize the most

                    <p class="py-3">1.Profitability: For financial gain (racing, breeding), or even for recreation
                        (hunting,
                        fighting),
                        people use companion animals. Animals that are too slow, old, or ill are no longer suitable for
                        their
                        "purpose" and are discarded(2013). </p>
                    <p>2.Financial Factor: Because their owner can no longer afford to care for them, pets are
                        frequently
                        abandoned. Many pet owners are unaware of the total cost of owning and caring for a pet. </p>
                    <p class="py-3">3.Animal Health and Age: Animals can develop acute or chronic illnesses, and they
                        may
                        require more
                        care
                        as they age due to medical issues that are age-related. This takes up more of the owner's time
                        and
                        could
                        cost money for the veterinarian.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">4.Lack of experience: Some pet owners lack the knowledge necessary to properly care

                        their animals
                        and
                        may consequently feel overburdened by their obligations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">5.Behavioral Issues: Some pet owners discover that their animal exhibits undesirable
                        behavior, such
                        as
                        dogs acting aggressively toward other dogs. When animals are young, they should be properly
                        trained
                        and
                        socialized to help prevent the development of behavioral problems. According to the ASPCA‚Äôs
                        National
                        Rehoming Survey, pet problems are the most common reason that owners rehome their pet,
                        accounting
                        for
                        47% of rehomed dogs and 42% of rehomed cats. Pet problems were defined as problematic behaviors,
                        aggressive behaviors, grew larger than expected, or health problems the owner couldn‚Äôt handle.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">After completing the above research on why people abandon small animals, we research

                How do we differ from our competitor Petfinder?

                We have done a questionnaire survey about personal information on Petfinder, a pet website, and we feel
                that
                their questions will not be flexible. To improve the efficiency of our questionnaire progress, the
                questionnaire we designed will automatically adjust the questions according to the answers of the
                respondents.

            <h2 class="cutefthin">Budget Breakdown</h2>
            <p class="mb-5"> We have $50000 budget in total. Animal Crossing organization is a non-profit organization,
                so when considering the budget for our event, our main budget is to pay our five employees who
                participated in the entire proposal and web app design. We will put the second largest budget on
                research, such as why people give up pets. Next, after completing the initial investment, we will also
                put the budget into promotion to let more people who love small animals understand our organization and
                find suitable cute pets on our website.
